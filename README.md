##Flesh Cards

User journey:
As a user I want to be able to:

* click on a button to add a new flesh-card to the deck;
* add a flash-card's title
* click on the flesh-card to "flip" it and add it's content
* choose which side of flash-card is visible (by clicking and flipping)
* click on a button to delete a card;
* edit card's content
* embed images
