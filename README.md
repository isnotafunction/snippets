##[Snippets](isnotafunction.github.io/snippets)

A personal non-linear note taking tool (wip)


As a user I want to be able to:

* click on a button to add a new snipped-card to the deck :check:
* add/edit title :check:
* add/edit card's content :check:
* click on a button to delete all storage and refresh :check:
* click on a button to delete a card :check:
* save content in browser's localStorage :check:
* change background colour
* change card's colour
* drag and drop cards

One day I want to be able to:
* resize the cards  
* add code editing bit using back ticks
* drag and drop images inside them

- research:
* find a better way to trigger storing of the edited text instead of timeout
* security issues with contenteditable?
* how to easily add html tags without rendering
