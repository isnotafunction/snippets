[## Snippets](https://isnotafunction.github.io/snippets/)

I built this simple non-linear note-taking tool to take quick notes in the browser while I'm working on something and research in depth/organise them later.

User journey:

As a user I want to be able to:

* click on a button to add a new snippet-card to the deck :white_check_mark:
* add/edit card's content :white_check_mark:
* click on a button to delete a card :white_check_mark:
* click on a button to delete all storage and refresh :white_check_mark:
* save content in browser's localStorage :white_check_mark:
* change background colour
* change card colour

One day I want to be able to:
* drag and drop cards
* resize cards  
* add code editor to a card using back ticks
* drag and drop images
* organise cards in collections

- research:
* a better way to trigger storing of the edited text instead of timeout
* security issues with localStorage?
* how to (easily) add html tags without rendering
